### Financial Calculator
<!-- Update with a concise title describing your feature. -->

### Feature Pitch Link
https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/806

### Problem Statement
This will create a new calculation mode, "Financial". It will be similar to the date calculator with a combobox at the top to choose modes (current modes are Tip and Compound Interest). Target audience: Anyone with financial assets to people going out for lunch.

### Evidence or User Insights
We should do this to offer more tools to calculator users and make this a more feature-packed calculator (GitHub issue: #806)

### Proposal
Create a new feature "Financial". With it, we can target investors and even students learning about financial responsibility.

### Goals and Non-Goals
## Goals
* Create a compound interest calculator
* Tips calculator

## Non-Goals
* Even more modes

### Success Criteria
Sucess can be mesured with users, and engagement time.

### Feature Requirements
* Users can input Base Rate, term, times compounded, and interest rate to get the future rate.
* Users can input the bill amout, tip percentage and if they want to split the bill (and if yes, between how many people) and recieve the result.

We can look at the [numberbox](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/blob/master/active/NumberBox/NumberBox.md#:~:text=Xaml%20has%20a%20TextBox%20control%20for%20text%20input%2C,not%20as%20part%20of%20the%20Windows%20OS.%20Description) from the XAML team (it dosen't come as part of Windows OS).

### Appendix
Phases:
Look at devoloping more modes later on.

Risks and Open Issues:
Open issue: I think the everything is up for discussion. 
Risks: I don't think there are.


Note: These are the earliest iterations of the calc and is _subject to change_.
